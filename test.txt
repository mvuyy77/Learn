This is a test to learn and see if Git is tracking my changes based on the .git that was added directly from git rather than creating a local .git
Now I am adding a new line .. coz I added a new file in another location. Hence testing to make sure that i understand how collaborative changes are reflected.
This is now added in Person2 folder.
